# Sales-Prediction-Linear-Regression

The challenge was taken from Kaggle whose goal is to build a model that predicts sales based on money spent across different marketing platforms.

I used the advertising dataset provided to analyze the relationship of the "TV", "Newspaper" and "Radio" columns to the "Sales" column.
After that I tested 3 types of regression model:
- Random Forest
- Linear Regression
- Extra Tree <br>
<br>
To determine which template to use I used two metrics:<br>
- RÂ² <br>
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) <br>
<br>
After choosing it, I compared in columns and graph the actual values with the forecast values. Finalizing the model.
